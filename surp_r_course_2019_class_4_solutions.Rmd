# Review: vectors, functions, and types
## Vectors and functions
```{r}
# Create a vector containing any 4 numbers
test_vector <- c(1,4,5,8)
# Calculate the sum of that vector and print it out on the screen
print(sum(test_vector))
```

Notice that lots of functions work on vectors!

## Vector types

What if we wanted to store the number 3 and the character "3" together in a vector?
```{r}
# Create a vector, mix_vector, with 3 and "3"
mix_vector <- c(3, "3")
# check the type of mix_vector
is(mix_vector)
# why is this happening (check the documentation of c)

```
Note that the documentation of `c` says, "All arguments are coerced to a common type" - in this case, everything inside the parentheses (the arguments) is being turned into a character. 

# Making consecutive sequences

Often you want to make a vector of integers.You can do this using a colon between two numbers. The number before the colon tells R where to start the sequence, and the number after tells it where to end. For example, if you type `2:5` into the console, you should see every integer from 2 to 5 printed. 

```{r}
#try making a sequence of numbers using :
2:5
```



One really useful thing we can do in R is make vectors of evenly spaced numbers. To do this, we can use the `seq()` function. Let's try to use the built-in R documentation of `seq()` to figure out how to use it.
```{r}
# On your own:
# Based on the documentation from of seq, make the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4

seq(1, 4)
# or
seq(from = 1, to = 4) # same thing as above

# In pairs:
# Now make the sequence: 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5
seq(from = 2, to = 3.5, by = .5)

# Identify what values are corresponding to what arguments

```

***
*Skip if behind*: 
Seq can work in both directions (i.e., the numbers don't have to be going up)
```{r}
# Use seq to make the following sequence: 5, 3, 1, -1
seq(from = 5, to = -1, by = -2)
```
Notice that here, 'by' is *negative*, since you want the sequence to go down with each step.
***

There are three things that make seq really powerful compared to just typing out vectors of numbers by hand:

1. It can generate reaaaaaally long sequences of numbers
2. Like all functions, it can use variables as inputs, which means you don't have to change your whole code every time you change your mind about what numbers you're interested in working with
3. When you want to make a vector of a certain length, it will do the math for you of what the spacing between your numbers needs to look like

Relatedly, a really useful function in R is `length()`. It can tell you how long your vector is (how many elements are in your vector)
```{r}
# Use length() to find out how long the first vector you made in this class is
length(test_vector)
```

# Operations on vectors of numbers

One of the best things about vectors that will come up again and again soon is that you can do operations on them, just like with numbers. Here's one example:
```{r}
# Create a variable holding a vector that contains an evenly spaced sequence of
# five numbers, from 2 to 4
test_vector_2 <- seq(from = 2, to = 4, length.out = 5)
print(test_vector_2)
# Add 3 to the vector. What happens?
test_vector_2 + 3
```

You can also add vectors together!
```{r}
vector_a <- c(1,2,3)
vector_b <- c(4,5,6)

# Add vector_a and vector_b
vector_a + vector_b
# What is happening? How is this different from adding 3 to a vector?
```
Here, each individual value in vector_a is being added to the corresponding position's value in vector_b

# Getting specific elements of vectors

Often, it's really useful to find out what the value of a specific position (or *index*) in a vector is. R makes this easy.
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./class_1_figures/vector_illustration1.png')
```

Let's create a really long vector and ask R to tell us about specific points along that vector.
```{r}
# Create three variables, first_num, last_num, and num_of_elements
# The first two can be whatever numbers you want, num_of_elements should be 100
# Actually: DON'T use 1 for first_num, and don't use 100 for last_num. Be creative.
first_num <- 3
last_num <- 1001
num_elements <- 100

# Use the function we learned about at the beginning of class to make a sequence
# of length num_of_elements starting at first_num and going to last_num, and
# put that in a vector called long_vector
test_vector_3 <- seq(from = first_num, to = last_num, length.out = num_elements)
# Check the length of the vector you just created
length(test_vector_3)
```

To access the number at a specific position, we can use square brackets!
```{r}
# Make a vector called Long_vector that goes from -1 to 50 and has 100 numbers inside
long_vector <- seq(-1, 50, length.out = 100)

# Let's check what the first number in long_vector is
print(long_vector[1])

# Now check what the 32nd number in long_vector is
print(long_vector[32])
```


***
*Skip if low on time*
```{r}
# Now check what the last number in long_vector is
# (bonus: do this using a variable you've already created, rather than just
# typing out 100)
long_vector_element_num <- length(long_vector)
print(long_vector[long_vector_element_num])
# or
print(long_vector[length(long_vector)])
```
***

You don't have to just provide a single number as in index (the thing inside the square brackets); vectors work too!
```{r}
# Print out the 4th, 5th, and 6th number in long_vector
print(long_vector[c(4,5,6)])

# Use something we have learned today to specificy 4, 5, 6
print(long_vector[4:6])
```

***
*skip if running low on time*

Actually, we can get even more creative here. Let's say you wanted to create a vector that had inside it *every other number* from *long_vector* (*i.e.* the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc numbers that are in *long_vector*). Let's try this.
Hint: you can use `seq()` to create a vector of positions (*indices*) that you then use to get the positions you want from long_vector
```{r}
# Create position_vector, which will hold the positions you want to get out of
# long_vector (i.e. c(1,3,5,....))
position_vector <- seq(from = 1, to = length(long_vector), by = 2)
# Use long_vector together with position_vector to create shorter_vector, which
# will hold every othern number from long_vector
shorter_vector <- long_vector[position_vector]
# print out shorter_vector
print(shorter_vector)
```

***

# Converting between numeric and character types
Finally, it's sometimes really helpful to be able to switch something between a numeric and a character type. Let's say you import some data and your computer insists on thinking it's letters, when it is clearly numbers (this happens a lot!) We can use the `as.numeric()` function to set things right.
```{r}
bad_numeric_vector <- c('1','3','4','7','11')

# check the type of bad_numeric_vector
is(bad_numeric_vector)

# why is it not numeric?

# use as.numeric() to create a new vector, good_numeric_vector, which has all
# the values from bad_numeric_vector but as numbers instead of characters
good_numeric_vector <- as.numeric(bad_numeric_vector)
# check the type of good_numeric_vector
is(good_numeric_vector)
```

We can also do this change backwards. Based on what you saw right above, what do you think the function is called that converts numeric values to character type?
```{r}
num_vector <- c(81, 243, 729)
print(num_vector)
# convert num_vector to a character vector
print(as.character(num_vector))
```
