This is an introductory R course intended for learners with no prior coding experience. It was initially put together the goal of helping introduce wet-lab researchers affected by university shutdowns during the spring of 2020 to learn the basics of programming in R, and borrows heavily from a [class taught to NYU summer research students](https://github.com/plavskin/SURP_R_course).
