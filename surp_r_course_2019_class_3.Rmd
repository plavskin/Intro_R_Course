# Review from last time
Let's use R to combine variables holding each of our names into a third variable that holds the combined name
```{r}
# Create two variables: last_name and first_name, holding your last and your
# first name, respectively

# Combine these two variables into a third variable, full_name, that contains
# your last name followed by your first name, with a semicolon and space in
# betweeen

# Get R to print out full_name on the screen
```

Write a code chunk below this line to find out what variables are in your environment using a function, and compare them to the variables listed in the **Environment** window in Rstudio

# Introduction to vectors

So far, we've been using R to do things we can easily do on our own, or with a simple calculator. We don't need R to add two numbers. But where programming languages start to get really powerful is when you have to do the same thing over and over. Today, we're going to learn how R deals with lists of multiple numbers or strings. These lists are called *vectors*. (Actually, a 'list' is also a thing in R, but it means something slightly different... very confusing. So let's stick with calling these things vectors.)

We can create a vector by using `c()`, with the things we want to put inside the vector going in parentheses. For example:
```{r}
# Create a vector
vector_1 <- c(1, 4, 3, 18)
print(vector_1)
```

You can use variables to define vectors too! Try it below:
```{r}
# Create 3 variables, named variable_1, variable_2, and bob, and have each of
# them hold a single number

# Combine these variables in any order you want into a vector named bob_the_vector

# print out bob_the_vector

```

Vectors can also hold character types!
```{r}
# Create a vector, char_vector_1 containing both strings and numbers, and print it out

```

Let's check the *types* that these vectors belong to
```{r}
# check the type of bob_the_vector

# check the type of char_vector_1

# by the way... what is the type of c()?

```

# Making consecutive sequences

One really useful thing we can do in R is make vectors of evenly spaced numbers. To do this, we can use the `seq()` function. Let's try to use the built-in R documentation of `seq()` to figure out how to use it.
```{r}
# On your own:
# Based on the documentation from of seq, make the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4

# In pairs:
# Now make the sequence: 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5

# Identify what values are corresponding to what arguments

```

Seq can work in both directions (i.e., the numbers don't have to be going up)
```{r}
# Use seq to make the following sequence: 5, 3, 1, -1

```

There are three things that make seq really powerful compared to just typing out vectors of numbers by hand:
1. It can generate reaaaaaally long sequences of numbers
2. Like all functions, it can use variables as inputs, which means you don't have to change your whole code every time you change your mind about what numbers you're interested in working with
3. When you want to make a vector of a certain length, it will do the math for you of what the spacing between your numbers needs to look like


## Operations on vectors of numbers

* Adding a single number to vector

* Adding two vectors of same size

* Warning: adding two vectors of different sizes

## Operations on vectors of characters

Paste function

## length()

## Indexing
Using position names instead of numerical position indices
```{r}
include_graphics('vector_illustration_names.png')
```

```{r}
include_graphics('vector_illustration1.png')
```
