# Review: vectors cont, missing values

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers from -5 to 5 increasing in increments of 0.5 called review_vec

# find the value of the 11th position in the vector 

# divide that by zero, and save it as a new variable called review_var what do you get?
```

## Logicals

In R, in addition to character and numeric values, we can have logical values. Logical values are `TRUE` and `FALSE`. These words, when you type them, are something like `NA` in that they're special words. 

Logical values are often generated by comparisons between two values. These comparisons are made with logical operators. Many of them you will be familiar with.

```{r Logic}
3 > 4
8 < 5
4 <= 4
```

Note that the logical operator "is equal to" is `==` in R. If you only use `=`, you will reassign your variable (that is `=` in R is the same as `<-`).  
"Not" is specified by `!`. So "is not equal to" is `!=`.

```{r}
TRUE == TRUE
TRUE == FALSE
TRUE != FALSE
3 != 4
char = 'a'
char == 'a'
char = 'b'
char == 'a'
```

One useful function that results in a logical value is `is.na()`
```{r}
# try using is.na() on position 11 in review_vec

# try using is.na() on review_var
```

Just like you can make a vector of characters or a vector of numeric values, you can also make a vector of logicals.
```{r}
# Make a vector with 3 TRUEs and 2 FALSEs, save it as logical_vec1

# Make a vector called num_vec that starts at 2 and ends at 10

logical_vec2 <- t%%3 == 2 #what is this line of code doing?
```


In R, FALSE is also encoded as 0, and TRUE is encoded as 1. 

```{r}
0==FALSE
1==TRUE
# How do you think we could easily figure out how many TRUEs there are in logical_vec2?

```

Numbers can be treated like logical values, especially with 
`as.logical()`. 0 is false, everything else is true.

```{r}
as.logical(-2:2)

sum(as.logical(-2:2)) # what is going on here?
```

* selecting and replacing values from vectors based on logicals

* operations on logicals (AND, OR)

We can also do "and" and "or". "And" only returns true if both things are true. "Or" returns true if at least one thing is true.

```{r}
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE | FALSE 
```
* which()
* mean() with na.rm = T

##Data Frames: Reading in and manipulating data, writing data

```{r}
include_graphics('./class_1_figures/df_illustration.png')
```


## Reading in tables from excel

Teach them about csv format

## Selecting data from data frames: row numbers and column numbers and $
  
## Creating new columns from operations on other columns

## Creating new data frames from scratch and writing them

## Watch out for factors!
